# Personas

Personas are custom AI identities that replace the default assistant. They shape the AI's tone, focus, and communication style for every message in a conversation.

## How Personas Work

When a persona is active, `buildSystemPrompt()` inserts the persona's name, personality, description, and full instruction body **before** the rest of the system prompt (user context, repos, skills, etc.). The AI then behaves according to the persona throughout the conversation.

There is always exactly one active state:
- **No persona set** → Default assistant (helpful, accurate, contextually aware)
- **Persona set** → That persona's identity takes over

The active persona is stored in `Data/ActivePersona.json`. When you switch personas, the system prompt cache is invalidated immediately.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Displayed in the Personas page, active banner, and system prompt |
| `personality` | Recommended | Comma-separated traits — shown as tags on the card |
| `description` | Recommended | One sentence subtitle shown on the card |

The **body** is injected directly into the system prompt as the persona's instructions. It can be as long and detailed as you want.

## Creating a New Persona

1. Create a new `.md` file in `Personas/`
2. Add the YAML frontmatter (name, personality, description)
3. Write the instruction body — be specific about communication style and what the persona does and doesn't do
4. Restart Evelina (personas are loaded at startup)
5. The new persona appears in the Personas page

### Tips for Effective Personas

**Be specific about voice.** "Punchy, no-filler sentences" is more actionable than "good communicator."

**Define what the persona avoids.** Negative constraints often shape behaviour more precisely than positive ones.

**Include example scenarios.** These help the AI recognise when to lean into the persona's strengths.

**Keep personality traits consistent.** The frontmatter personality field should match the instruction body's tone.

**Don't over-constrain.** The persona works on top of the base AI — you don't need to define every behaviour, just the distinctive ones.

## The Personas Page

The Personas page (person icon in sidebar) shows all available personas as a grid of cards.

Each card shows:
- Avatar with initials
- Name and description
- Personality trait tags
- **Activate** / **Deactivate** / **Currently active** button
- **Chat** button — activates and immediately navigates to chat

The **active banner** at the top shows which persona is currently active (or "Default Assistant" if none).

Search works across name, personality tags, description, and instruction body.
