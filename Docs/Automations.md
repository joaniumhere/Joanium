# Automations

Evelina's automation engine lets you schedule sequences of actions — no code required.

---

## How It Works

Automations are stored in `Data/Automations.json`. The `AutomationEngine` (a singleton in the main process) loads them on startup and runs a tick every 60 seconds to check scheduled triggers.

On startup, all `on_startup` automations run immediately. Scheduled automations are checked every minute — the engine compares the trigger definition against the current time and `lastRun` timestamp.

After each successful execution, `lastRun` is updated and persisted. This prevents an automation from running twice in the same scheduled window (e.g., a daily automation won't re-run if you restart the app later the same day).

---

## Triggers

### On Startup
Runs every time Evelina is launched. Useful for morning briefings, workspace setup, or opening your daily tools.

### Every N Minutes
`interval` trigger. Set any interval from 1 to 1440 minutes. The engine uses elapsed time since `lastRun` — if the app was closed, it runs immediately on next launch if the interval has passed.

### Every Hour
Runs at minute 0 of each hour while the app is open. Does not catch up on missed hours.

### Daily at Time
Runs once per day at a specific `HH:MM` time. The engine compares `hour` and `minute` — if the app is open at that time, the automation fires. If the app was closed, it will NOT run retroactively.

### Weekly on Day
Runs once per week on a specific day and time. Same caveat as daily — the app must be running at the scheduled time.

## Debugging Automations

- **Check the app console** — the AutomationEngine logs every action it runs (or fails on) to `console.log` / `console.error`. Open DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) while the main window is open.
- **Last run timestamp** — visible on each automation card. If it's outdated, the trigger might not be matching.
- **Gmail / GitHub not connected** — actions that require connectors will throw a clear error: "Gmail not connected — connect in Settings → Connectors".
- **Toggle off/on** — disable an automation and re-enable it to reset its state.
- **IPC** — if you suspect the UI isn't saving correctly, check `Data/Automations.json` directly.
